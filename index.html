    text: "The Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the planet’s lungs, plays a critical role in the Earth’s ecosystem by producing approximately 20% of the world’s oxygen. Spanning over 5.5 million square kilometers, it stretches across nine countries in South America, including Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. This vast region is covered by dense forests and river systems and is considered one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. The rainforest is home to an estimated 390 billion individual trees, belonging to around 16,000 different species. In addition to trees, the Amazon is inhabited by millions of animal and insect species, many of which scientists have not yet documented. These include rare birds, frogs, jaguars, and even undiscovered microorganisms. The forest’s rich vegetation and high humidity help regulate global temperatures and rainfall patterns. However, deforestation and climate change are posing serious threats to this vital ecosystem. If the rainforest continues to shrink, it could reduce its oxygen production and increase carbon levels globally. Preserving the Amazon is essential for maintaining environmental balance, protecting wildlife, and supporting indigenous communities who depend on its resources for survival.",

    text: "The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic man-made structures in history, recognized worldwide for its size and significance. Originally built to protect Chinese states from northern invasions, especially by nomadic tribes, it served as a defense system and border control. Construction began as early as the 7th century BC, and the Wall was expanded and rebuilt over centuries by different dynasties, particularly the Qin, Han, and Ming. Stretching over 13,000 miles, the Great Wall crosses mountains, deserts, and grasslands. It is made from a variety of local materials, including stone, wood, tamped earth, and bricks, depending on the region. In many parts, watchtowers and fortresses were added to provide better surveillance and communication. Beyond its military purpose, the Wall also played a role in regulating trade and immigration. Over time, it became a cultural symbol of Chinese strength and unity. Today, the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists each year. While some sections are well-preserved, others have eroded due to natural forces and human activity.",
    questions: [
      { q: "Why was the Great Wall originally built?", options: ["For trade", "As a monument", "For tourism", "For protection"], answer: 3 },

    text: "Photosynthesis is a vital biological process that allows green plants to convert light energy into chemical energy. It mainly takes place in the leaves of the plant, where special pigments called chlorophyll absorb sunlight. This light energy is then used to transform carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air and water (H₂O) from the soil into glucose, a type of sugar that plants use for energy and growth. During this chemical reaction, oxygen (O₂) is produced as a byproduct and released into the atmosphere. This process not only sustains plant life but also provides the oxygen necessary for most living organisms on Earth to survive. Chloroplasts, the small structures inside plant cells, are responsible for carrying out photosynthesis. Conditions such as sunlight, water availability, and temperature influence how efficiently plants perform this process. Since photosynthesis helps remove carbon dioxide from the air and produce oxygen, it plays an essential role in regulating the Earth’s atmosphere. Without it, the balance of gases would shift, impacting climate and life on the planet. Understanding photosynthesis is fundamental to biology, agriculture, and even climate science.",
    questions: [
      { q: "What do plants convert light energy into?", options: ["Oxygen", "Chlorophyll", "Chemical energy", "Sunlight"], answer: 2 },
      { q: "Where does photosynthesis mainly occur?", options: ["Roots", "Leaves", "Stem", "Flowers"], answer: 1 },
      { q: "What captures sunlight?", options: ["Glucose", "Chlorophyll", "Oxygen", "Water"], answer: 1 },
      { q: "What gas do plants need for photosynthesis?", options: ["Nitrogen", "Hydrogen", "Carbon dioxide", "Oxygen"], answer: 2 },
      { q: "What do plants release after photosynthesis?", options: ["Carbon", "Oxygen", "Nitrogen", "Chlorine"], answer: 1 }

    text: " Mount Everest, standing at 8,848 meters above sea level, is the tallest mountain on Earth. Located in the Himalayan mountain range, it forms part of the natural border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Everest attracts thousands of climbers from around the world who attempt to reach its summit, often considered one of the greatest achievements in mountaineering. However, the journey to the top is extremely dangerous and challenging. Climbers face harsh weather conditions, freezing temperatures, low oxygen levels, and the constant risk of avalanches. Altitude sickness is a serious concern, affecting the body’s ability to function due to decreased oxygen at high elevations. Despite the risks, Everest remains a powerful symbol of adventure and perseverance. The mountain was first successfully summited in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal. Today, modern equipment and guided expeditions have made the climb more accessible, but it still demands preparation, strength, and courage. Many climbers view Everest as a once-in-a-lifetime challenge. Environmental concerns, including waste left by climbers, are now being addressed to protect this iconic natural wonder.",
